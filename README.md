I begin each day with an hour of practice working with datastructures and building algorithms. The files attached are challenges from Codewars.com. I take a different approach with each file and note the intention at the beginning in the comments. Sometimes the intention is to use the least number of lines, other times it might be to write everything by hand and not using pre-built methods.
